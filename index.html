						FOLLOW MY FITNESS JOURNEY

					<p>
						All my life I have struggled with my weight even as a young child. From elementary school to my adulthood, being overweight
						was always challenging because of my addiction to food. Not just any food. Sweets were (and still is) my weakness. My favorite 
						foods were: Chinese, macaroni and cheese, lasagna , mostacolli, fried shrimp and fish. I was never a big veggie or fruit person
						unless the veggies had butter and cheese or the fruit was in ice cream.

						With our roots stretching as far as Tuscaloosa,Alabama, our food portions were mighty and just down right delicious.
						Our dinners, get togethers, picnics and reunions were always a competition. I learned how to cook from my mother and aunts.
						They taught me that a way to a man's heart was food and be sure to be able to cook and in plentiful! The way my mother and 
						aunts taught me to cook was that of lots of butter, oils, fats and fun. I loved cooking big for family gatherings, but now
						my mindset had to change. I couldn't treat food the same going forward.

						In December 2013,I found myself losing control in my life around food. On talk shows, new casts and it seemed as though it 
						Dr.Ian Smith was everywhere on my tv and in my living room. I felt as though this was a sign to kickstart my next journey. For
						Christmas, I bought the book to not only learn how to eat, but to eat to live.

						Here is a pre-photo of me before getting started on my weight loss journey that was ahead of me. On this photo, my starting 
						weight was 270 pounds. It was becoming dangerous as my blood pressure was rising and I was on the verge of beginning to use
						insulin to control and maintain my diabetes. Enough was enough and this was my kickstart to a new life!

						My sons are my world. As I was risking my health and well-being I knew a change had to be made for the betterment of 
						myself and for my children. As a diabetic and dealing with high blood pressure, I was taking more pills than I could 
						stomach to keep it under control. They were my reason for wanting to extend my life and to show them a better way to 
						live, eat and love. Here is a before picture of my family:

						I have my "Shred It" book and YouTube to do my online workouts. The book outlines my menu and workout plan. This information
						alone helps me to start the right way. I'm seeing and loving food differently. Now my journey begins...

						Eleven months into my journey has been a long road. I am now trying and loving foods I would have not have ever tried before. 
						I am exercising and being very active with my children. I am holding myself accountable for my intake and my output. There's 
						a way to love food without over indulging. This is becoming my new normal.

						One day in December 2014, as I was sitting in the nail shop awaiting a pedicure, I took my right leg to cross over my left leg. When I tell you
						at the moment I almost cried... I really almost cried because in all my adult years I always wanted to know how to cross my 
						legs like "normal" people. That may seem small to you, but this meant everything to me. Someone who never had the pleasure of
						someting as simple as sitting with good posture and legs crossed like a boss. I was a boss in my own right. I was definitely
						beginning to own my life.

						January 16, 2015 was my 1 year weight loss anniversary. Don't laugh! We have to celebrate every accomplishment we fulfill. 
						Looking at where I was and where I was going was coming from the same person, yet different in so many ways. Mentally, I was
						stronger, emotionally I was braver, physically I was transforming and spiritually I was evolving. How great it was to have reached
						a weight loss of 50 lbs. At this doctor's appointment I was informed that I was being removed from my Metformin (a medicine for 
						diabetics) and the doctor even suggested removing me from blood pressure meds. This was an amazing start to something great. By 
						March 2015, look at my transformation.

						As the years have come and gone, one thing remains the same... My committment to me is still the same. The love I have for me and my 
						family is an unbreakable bond. The love I have for food is still a struggle, but I press forward daily. I am working out and watching
						my intake and being more cognizant of what I do with my health. I can't tell you it has been easy, but I can tell you it has all been 
						worth evey ounce of my journey. I tell anyone and everyone, if I can do it so can you. Believe that you can do it, set a goal and 
						achieve it. The small victories are the best! It reminds you are on your way to destined greatness!
